[ASF](https://asf.alaska.edu)
  Alaska satellite facility. NASA distributed active archive center (DAAC) specializing 
  in radar products.

[Binder](https://mybinder.org)
    A free, public service for running reproducible interactive computing environments.
    Binder is a 100% open source infrastructure that is run by members of the Jupyter
    community. The underlying technology behind the Binder project is {term}`BinderHub`.

[BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    The underlying technology of mybinder.org, BinderHub is an open source tool that
    runs on Kubernetes and utilizes a {term}`JupyterHub` in order to provide live, 
    reproducible interactive computing environments that users host on GitHub.

GRD
  "Ground range detected". Common real-valued georeferenced SAR amplitude product.
  
[Hackweek](https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/intro.html)
  Participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces to learn new things, 
  build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science.

InSAR 
  "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar". Method to create relative phase change
  maps or "interferograms" from two synthetic aperture radar acquisitions.

[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
    Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality 
    books and documents from computational material.

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    A core open source tool from the Jupyter community, JupyterHub allows you to
    deploy an application that provides remote data science environments to multiple
    users. It can be deployed in the cloud, or on your own hardware.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
    intended to replace the JupyterNotebook interface.

RPI
  "Repeat pass interferometry". When two SAR acquistions of the same location are 
  acquired at different times.

SLC 
  "Single look complex". Common complex-valued SAR amplitude and phase product.

[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov)
  "Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar". Airborn L-band InSAR platform.
